  <b><h1>Machine Learning Portfolio</h1></b>


Welcome to the Machine Learning repository!

This repository contains a collection of machine learning assignments and projects. The goal of this repository is to provide a comprehensive resource for learning about machine learning and its various applications.

<br/>

## Overview of Machine Learning
Open this [document](Overview_of_ML.pdf) to learn more about Machine Learning.

This document provides an overview of Machine Learning (ML), which is a branch of Artificial Intelligence that analyzes data to find patterns and automate existing functionalities. The importance of data, pattern recognition, and accuracy in ML is emphasized, as they are crucial in making work faster and more efficient. The relationship between AI and ML is also discussed, where ML is a method to analyze data and improve the performance of a given task. Two examples of modern ML applications are listed, including Finance and Healthcare. The document also defines and discusses the importance of observation, feature, quantitative data, and qualitative data in ML. Finally, I express my personal interest in ML for its potential healthcare applications and aims to learn more about it for personal projects or professional applications.

<div align="left">

Objectives:
  * ‚úçüèª Create a GitHub portfolio for class work
  * ‚úçüèª Summarize the main branches of ML algorithms
  * ‚úçüèª Reflect on your personal interest in ML 
  
</div>

## C++ Data Exploration
Review the simple example of analyzing the given data [document](C++%20Data%20Exploration/Cpp_Data_Exploration_Overview.pdf)
And review the [program](C++%20Data%20Exploration/main.cpp)

This C++ program analyzes statistical data stored in a CSV file called "Boston.csv". It reads in two sets of data, "rm" and "medv", and calculates their sum, mean, median, range, covariance, and correlation. The program includes functions to perform each of these calculations, as well as a main function that reads in the data and prints out the results.

<div align="left">

Objectives:
  * ‚úçüèª In class, we covered how to do data exploration with statistical functions in R
  * ‚úçüèª In this assignment, you recreate that functionality in C++ code
  * ‚úçüèª This will prepare us to write algorithms in C++ in future assignments

## Linear Models
This data analysis is on earthquake data for the last 123 years. 

Analysis of [regression](Linear%20Models/Regression.pdf)
Analysis of [classification](Linear%20Models/Classification.pdf)

The task involves creating two Rmd notebooks: Regression and Classification. The Regression notebook requires selecting a data set with a target column suitable for regression, dividing it into train/test, exploring the data with at least 5 R functions, creating graphs, building and comparing three linear regression models with different predictors, and evaluating the results on test data using metrics correlation and mse. The Classification notebook involves selecting a data set with a target column suitable for classification, dividing it into train/test, exploring the data with at least 5 R functions, creating graphs, building and comparing a logistic regression model and a naive Bayes model, evaluating the results on test data using classification metrics, and discussing the strengths and weaknesses of the models and metrics.

<div align="left">

Objectives:
  * ‚úçüèª Perform data cleaning and data exploration on medium-sized data sets
  * ‚úçüèª Perform machine learning using linear models
  * ‚úçüèª Evaluate model performance 

</div>
<br/>

## C++ Algorithms from Scratch

Logictic regression [code](C++%20Algorithms%20from%20Scratch/logisticRegression.cpp)
Naive Bayes [code](C++%20Algorithms%20from%20Scratch/naiveBayes.cpp)

This task involves two programs written in C++ to perform logistic regression and Na√Øve Bayes classification on the Titanic data. The first program performs logistic regression from scratch and predicts survival based on sex, using the first 800 observations for training. The second program implements Na√Øve Bayes using predictors age, pclass, and sex to predict survival, using the first 800 observations for training and the rest for testing. The programs output test metrics and run times, and functions to calculate accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity are also written. Finally, a document is required that includes the code output and analysis of the algorithms on the Titanic data, a comparison of generative and discriminative classifiers, and a discussion on reproducible research in machine learning citing sources.

<div align="left">

Objectives:
  * ‚úçüèª Gain a deeper understanding of machine learning algorithms by coding from scratch
  * ‚úçüèª Further C++ skills in ML
  * ‚úçüèª Understand the importance of reproducible research  
  
</div>

## Searching For Similarity

[Notebook 1](Searching%20For%20Similarity/WalmartData.pdf)

This task involves performing regression analysis on a medium-sized dataset with at least 10,000 rows. The dataset should be linked in markdown. The data is divided into a train/test set and is then explored statistically and graphically. The notebook then uses three different regression techniques (linear regression, kNN regression, and decision tree regression) to analyze the data, and the results are compared. Finally, an analysis is provided to explain why the results were achieved, based on how the algorithms work.

<div align="left">

Objectives:
  * ‚úçüèª Gain experience with machine learning using similarity models kNN and Decision Trees
  * ‚úçüèª Gain experience with clustering methods kMeans, hierarchical clustering
  * ‚úçüèª Gain experience with dimensionality reduction techniques LDA and PCA

</div>
<br/>

## Python Machine Learning

[Sklearn](Python%20ML%20with%20sklearn/Ml_with_sklearn.ipynb%20-%20Colaboratory.pdf)

This assignment involves working with the Auto dataset. I used pandas to read and explore the data, including outputting the first few rows and dimensions of the data. Additionally, I checked and changed the data types of columns and dealt with NAs by deleting rows. Furthermore, I modified columns by creating a new categorical column and deleting some existing columns. I explored the data further by creating graphs using seaborn, and wrote comments on what I learned from each graph. I then split the data into train and test sets and used logistic regression, decision tree, and neural network models to train and evaluate the data. Finally, I compared the performance of the models and provided an analysis of which algorithm performed better.

<div align="left">

Objectives:
  * ‚úçüèª Gain experience with machine learning in sklearn on a small data set
  * ‚úçüèª Compare experience in R versus sklearn 

</div>
<br/>

## Image Classification

For this assignment, I went to Kaggle.com and found an image classification data set that interested me. I divided the data into train and test sets and created a graph to show the distribution of the target classes. I then described the data set and what the model should be able to predict.

Next, I created a sequential model and evaluated it on the test data. After that, I tried different architectures such as RNN, CNN, etc., and evaluated them on the test data. I also explored using a pretrained model and transfer learning, which involved reading more about it in the TensorFlow documentation.

Finally, I wrote up my analysis of the performance of the various approaches that I tried.

<div align="left">

Objectives:
  * ‚úçüèª Gain experience with Keras
  * ‚úçüèª Gain experience with image classification
  * ‚úçüèª Gain experience with deep learning model variations and embeddings
